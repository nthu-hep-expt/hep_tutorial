# Machine Learning

## Introduction

In high energy experiment at CERN, we always use TMVA to run the MVA training with root nTuple. There are also many novel ways to train the MVA with Python packages like XGBoost, Keras and Tensorflow with Pandas dataframe. In the following, we will provide some hands-on example with TMVA and python packages.

## Hands-on examples

### TMVA

TMVA stands for The Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis, it lets you perform multivariate classification and multivariate regression analysis. See the [TMVA User Guide](https://root.cern.ch/download/doc/tmva/TMVAUsersGuide.pdf) or [TMVA tutorial](https://github.com/lmoneta/tmva-tutorial) for more information. 



When you're done, you can visualize the results by using

```bash
root -l -e 'TMVA::TMVAGui("test.root")' 
```
