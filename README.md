## Overview

In this tutorial, we introduce topics and technical details related to physics analysis in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. We also **include hand-on sessions to follow and start your analysis!**

The tutorial is separated into several parts. 

\*\*\*\*[**NTHU HEP group**](intro.md) will summarize the informations about the NTHU HEP group leaded by Jennifer. 

\*\*\*\*[**Basic knowledge**](basic_knowledge/) will briefly introduce the knowledge of the particle physics in the ATLAS experiment. 

\*\*\*\*[**Connect to the server**](connect_to_the_server/) ****is a section to give an introduction to Linux system and the computing resources we used at CERN and in NTHU group. 

\*\*\*\*[**ROOT**](root/) will talk about how to work with ROOT and produce results with it. 

\*\*\*\*[**Work with git**](git/) ****give a quick review of the commands used for git.

\*\*\*\*[**Physics analysis in ATLAS**](physics_analysis/) provides a series of introductions about the analyses, we involved in the ATLAS experiment, and their analysis frameworks. Several meetings and tutorial sections are included in the tutorial, which will help you quickly begin your researches. 

Moreover, we also try to teach you with our experiences working on the physics analysis and introduce some jargons used in this field. 

[**Resources**](resource/) ****provides many links to different activities important to improve you skills and survive in the large collaboration. We also provide some tips about how to make your slides and posters. Furthermore, an Latex thesis template is also included in this section.
